## Logs:

* 21/11/2020: **Preliminary structure** decided.
* 22/11/2020: Due to the limitation of our computational resource, we decided to compose our Task-oriented Dialogue System **FROM SCRATCH**.
* 23/11/2020: The **Translator**(v0.1.x are based on Google Translator), **Discriminator** modules completed. DM part(v 0.1.0) partially finished.
* 25/11/2020: New features added for system(v 0.1.1): **Typo handling**, **None-value handling**, **Conclusion function** finished.
* 26/11/2020: New features added for system(v 0.1.2): **New UI**, **“Outliers” handling** finished.
* 27/11/2020: New features added for system(v 0.1.3): **Evaluator**, **Intention correction** finished.
* 28/11/2020: New features added for system(v 0.1.4): **New UI**, **Evalutor debugging** finished.
* 29/11/2020: New features added for system(v 0.1.5): **Evaluator debugging** finished.
* 7/12/2020: New features added for system(v 0.1.6): **Intention Detection debugging** finished, now the intention detector is able to accept multi-words inputs. **Translator Module modified** several more backends included.

## Guidance:

* Preparations: ``` Python 3.6.x ```, [translators](https://github.com/UlionTse/translators)
* How to run: ``` python main.py --num_of_turns 10 --task_reward 20 --turn_penalty -1 --score_factor 2 --translator bing ```

## Notice:

* Google Translator might not work due to **high volume** of current user requests. In order to avoid request failure, now the Translator module supports multiple backends. Currently(v 0.1.6), the module has **Google** and **Bing** as its backup backends. We will add more backends in later versions.
